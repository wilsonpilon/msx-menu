       Sound Effect Editor v3.10 A (25/01/94)	    (c) FUZZY LOGIC 1991/95
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       SEE  v3.xx is NOT a 100% Public Domain program, but it's SHAREWARE! 
       This means that the program may never be sold for profit other than 
       the costs  of the  disc/service. You can use SEE v3.xx just for zip 
       and my copy it as much as necessary. However, when you use SEE 3.xx 
       for  a commercial product, an amount of money has to be paid to the 
       coders (that's us). Contact us at the addresses given at the end of 
       this doc. For any update check your PD dealer.


				 INSTALLING SEE

       SEE v3.xx can be installed on every (MSX-DOS) disc and even on your 
       hard disc. It's NOT (yet) fully DOS 2.x compatible, so use it under 
       BASIC if you can. You should copy the folowing files to boot SEE:

       - SEEv3_10.bin	The BASIC loader ( bload "SEEv3_10.bin",r )
       - SEEv3_10.lib	The program itselves.
       - SEE3	 .prf	The preference file (not realy necessary to copy)

       On the  master disc there's also a SEE3 replay source_file which is 
       originally written in WBass2, but we saved it as an ASCII file. The 
       name of this file:

       - SEE3PLAY.asc	The assembly source file (replayer)
       We  fixed a major bug in this version, so you'd better use this one 
       for correct SFX!

       This time a PSG drumkit as an example for you lot, the name:

       - SEEDRUMS.see	The example SEE3.10 file.


		   UPDATE OUTLINES from SEE v2.xx to SEE v3.xx

       Why  a new  version of  SEE you	might ask.  Well to be short, SEE2 
       wasn't as  perfect as  we thought it was. This total new version is 
       much  different from  all the other versions we've released before. 
       Some advantages towards SEEv2.xx are:

       o  Much easier and there for faster to edit.
       o  More	than one  pattern on  your screen.
       o  Block commands, which make editing much quicker.
       o  New options that does a lotta work for ye.
       o  A total new  file_format, which  will be  reduced in length when 
	  saving it on disk.


			   UPDATE from v3.00 to v3.10

       o  It works 100% under DOS2 (BASIC!!).
       o  You can boot from any drive and (sub)directory now.
       o  Correct file checking when opening a .SEE file.
       o  The nasty mouse shit has been removed (except in EDIT mode).
	  The real mouse/PDM routs have to be coded some day.
       o  The replayer had a bug in the Volume routine. (when you set
	   MAXVOL on a lower scale than 15, some volume slides would be
	   fucked up, I finally fixed it...)
       o  I forgot to clear the Tuning Bits in the rustle channels, when
	  they were displayed.




			      THINX FOR THE FUTURE

       o  Fully DOS 2 compatible, so it can be booted from the DOS shell.
       o  Together with DOS 2, a directory select option (maybe).
       o  The cruncher in Diskmode (together with the decrunch source?)
	  or something simular to that.      
       o  100% correct use of the mouse (I wrote this before....)
       o  Printer  options  (altought  it sounds  unnecessary, it  can be 
	  very usefull!).
       o  A possibility to run more than just 1 SFX at the same time!


				 BUGS WE KNOW OF

       The .PRF file, who is not saved -IN- SEE but -WITH- SEE.
       You can't enter a VARIABLE while CAPS is ON (stupid KB routs..)


				MAIN EDIT SCREEN

       In this	(main) screen, the SFX editor is stored. At the top of the 
       screen  you'll find some options (main menu), which can be selected 
       with you cursors.
       At  the middle  of the  screen, there  are the  SFX patters. It can 
       display a  maximum of  13 patterns  at the  time. When moving up or 
       down,  the patterns  will scroll at the opposide direction. The 7nd 
       pattern, which is lighted by a bar, is the current one to edit.
       At the  bottem of  the screen  you'll always  find the STATUS line. 
       Every action is displayed on this line.

				  PATTERN EDIT

       The  pattern  box  shows  13 patterns.  The one	you are  currently 
       editing on, is lighted up with a bar.
       One pattern contains 11 channels (Event and PSG data).

				    CHANNELS:

       - event (1)	In this extra channel you can set some commands. 
			For further details look at "Event channel".
       - snd# (2/3/4)	Same as PSG channels 0/1, 2/3 or 4/5. Here you can
			set the pattern sound frequency. When there's no
			data displayed, this channel is switched of auto-
			maticly (see "Sound channels").
       - rus# (5/6/7)	Same as PSG channel 6. This is the rustle channel 
			for  this   pattern.  There  is  only  one  rustle 
			register,  but	you  can  select  it for  each PSG 
			sound  channel (1,2  or 3).  When there's  no data 
			displayed the  rustle for  this channel  is turned 
			off (see "Rustle channels").
       - vol# (8/9/10)	Same as PSG channels 8/9/10. In these channels you 
			can  set the volume for PSG channels 1,2 or 3 (see 
			"Volume channels").
       - wave (11)	Same as  PSG channel 13. Here you can select the 
			Volume	envelope.  When it  contains no  data, the 
			volume wave  mode has not been used in one of the
			volume channels (see "Wave channel").
       - time  (12)	Same  as PSG  channels 11/12.  This contains  the 
			volume	envelope time.	If no volume wave has been 
			used,  this  channel displays  no data	(see "Wave 
			channel").


       Event channel

       In this channel can set some pattern commands like loop, speed etc. 
       The folowing commands are included:

	--	Empty. Does nothing extra, just play the pattern.
       HALT (x) Wait for a little while BEFORE playing the CURRENT pattern
		data.
		In: x, total v_blanks (timed at 1/50 or 1/60 sec.)
       FOR  (x) Set loop start pointer. A total of 4 loops can be mixed.
		In: x, total reloops.
       NEXT	Jump back to the pattern where you've set a FOR command if
		FOR (x)>0.
       START	Set rerun pointer.
       RERUN	Go to pattern where you've set START.
       TMP  (x) Set replay tempo (timed in v_blanks).
       END	End of effect.

       To  edit these  events, just press the first letter of the command. 
       Like "E" for END, "R" for RERUN etc. Use Backspace to clear.


		example FOR/NEXT event:

			pat:	event:	psg data channels
			+-------+------------ -- -  -
			000	 FOR 7	xxx yyy zzz
			001	  -	xxx yyy zzz
			002	 NEXT	 -   -	 -
			003	 END	 -   -	 -

		Pattern 000+001 will be repeated 7 times.

       Sound channel (1,2,3)

       In this	channel you  can set  the sound frequency of each channel. 
       There  are  3  sound  channels  available.  In  SEE2  and  previous 
       versions,  you could  set both  the High  and Low  registers of the 
       frequency.  In  SEE3,  these  two registers  are combined  into one 
       register pare. It has a range from 000 to FFF.

       In these sound channels you can also set some extra effects. To set 
       these effects use SHIFT together with a key (first letter of com.).
       The effects:
	D:xxx	 Down slide (frequency Down)	[shift + "D"/"d"]
	U:xxx	 Up slide (frequency Up)	[shift + "U"/"u"]
	(xxx = slide rate)

       Note:  Down slide means that the value will decrease, but the sound 
       you'll hear will go UP and vice versa! (only in frq channels).
 
       To switch the channel off, simply press on Backspace.


       Rustle channel (1,2,3)

       For every  sound channel  you can  set the rustle channel. However, 
       there's  only one  PSG rustle register so all channels will use the 
       same amount  of rustle.	But to use it in a channel you MUST define 
       it!.

       Like  the  sound  channels,  you  can slide  up and  down with  the 
       following effects:
	D:xx	 Down slide
	U:xx	 Up slide
	(xx = slide rate)

       Backspace to switch 1 channel off.


       Volume channel (1,2,3)

       Each  channel uses  it's own volume range which can be set in these 
       channels.

       Also in this channel you can find some extra effects:
	D:x	 Down slide
	U:x	 Up slide
	Wave	 Volume development (PSG standard)
	(x = slide rate)

       The PSG	has 15	standard volume  waves (development). When you use 
       such  a wave,  set the  development pattern  & time  in the  last 2 
       channels (wave/time).

 
       Wave channel (pattern/time)

       In this	channel the volume development pattern can be set. It will 
       be  displayed only  when one  or more  volume channels  are using a 
       (standard) wave. Other wise it will be switched of automatically.
 
       The development	time for  such a  pattern, can	be set in the last 
       channel. It's a combination of PSG regs 11 and 12 (000-FFF).

       Maybe   in  a   next  version   I'll  remove  the  standard  volume 
       development, 'cos  no one is using it anyway (atleast I don't) and 
       I think it doesn't even work yet!!.

				      BLOCK

       In this	version we  finally added some block functions. This block 
       is   very  usefull  for	quick  editing.  There's  only  one  block 
       available, the  start/end pats  will be	displayed at the main-menu 
       (Block: xxx-yyy x=start, y=end pat). When a block has been defined, 
       the patterns in this block will be lichted up with a colour bar.

       To  enter the  block commands  use the  [CODE] key. [CODE]+[S] will 
       set the start pattern while [CODE]+[E] will set the end pattern. To 
       remove this  block simply press [CODE]+space. For further functions 
       see Appendix A (keys).


				   PREFERENCES

       At this	screen, you'll  be able to edit some (screen)-settings the 
       way  you like'em  best. The preferences will be saved as "SEE3.prf" 
       on the  current drive (the one you've selected in the DiskOp).
       When this  file is present while booting SEE, it will automatically 
       be included in.

 
				   DISK MODE

       In  this screen	you can save/load SFX files. Even a disk_format is 
       included here. The disk mode contains 2 different file types:

	- filename.SEE	 All SFX saved in 1 file.
	- filename.SFX	 Save/Load only 1 SFX.

       The .SEE file_format will be detailed at Appendix B.

       When  loading  a .SFX  file, you've  gotta be  sure you've  set the 
       current	SFX   start  pattern.	If  not,  SEE  will  prenounce	an 
       error-message.
       When saving  a .SFX file, be sure you set the start pattern and any 
       End-Of-SFX  command  (event:  "END" or  "RERUN")! SEE3  will always 
       check  if  you've  set  correct  pattern  data  otherwise  it  will 
       prenounce a error-message.

       SEE will check if a .SEE file you're trying to load, is one of the 
       v3.xx type.

       When  you're  using  more  than  1  drive,  you  can  increase  the 
       default_drive by clicking on "DRIVE:".

       If you want to check your disk directory, press on DIR .SEE/SFX. If 
       you've done this before (and still using the same disk) then simply 
       press RETurn  on any .SEE or .SFX item. SEE3 will remember the last 
       DIRectory  from	both  filetypes!  When	entering DiskOp,  the last 
       filetype DIR will be displayed (if present).

       We  didn't include  the cruncher yet, that's why this option is not 
       available. In  the next	update, it  will be fixed (hope so...). In 
       the mean time you could try to crunch it yerself.


       Well, what's  more to  say. If  you think  SEE3 could  be better or 
       you've  found  any  buggies,  please  contact  us  at the  folowing
