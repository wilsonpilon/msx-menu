Now you have no excuse.

Code extremely tested. It seems to work with ALL the PT3 modules. For more
info about it and all the people involved in this great player go to
http://bulba.at.kz (VT II v1.0 PT3 player for ZX Spectrum).

Features
--------
-Can be compiled at any address (i.e. no need rounding .org
 address).
-Variables (VARS) can be located at any address (not only after
 code block).
-INIT subroutine detects module version and rightly generates
 both note and volume tables outside of code block (in VARS).
-Two portamento (spc. command 3xxx) algorithms (depending of
 module version).
-Any Tempo value are accepted (including Tempo=1 and Tempo=2).
-Fully compatible with Ay_Emul PT3 player codes.
