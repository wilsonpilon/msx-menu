XPCtools is a set of tools to create and maintain patch files (XPC files) of
ExecROM.

A XPC file contains one ore more blocks of modifications to be applied to a
ROM when ExecROM loads it. Each block has a textual description of the
modification and a flag that signals if it must be asked to the user before
being applied.
Yet, each block may contain up to 255 lumps of ROM modifications. Each lump
may contain up to 255 bytes to be modified. A modification is just a set
of bytes that will replace the original on specific position (given a 8KB
page and offset inside that page) of the ROM.

XPCtools may be copied, modified and distributed freely under the Free Software
Foundation's GPL version 2 license.

- Tool list:

xpcapply
--------

PURPOSE:
Applies patches from a XPC file to a ROM

SINTAX:
xpcapply romfile [xpcfile] [-o modifiedromfile] [-ask|-askall]

NOTES:
if xpcfile is omitted or "-", it will be read from stdin
if output ROM file is omitted, original ROM file itself will be modified


xpccat
------

PURPOSE:
Concatenates one or more XPC files together.

SYNTAX:
xpccat xpcfile1 [xpcfile2 [xpcfile3 ...]] [-o outputxpcfile]

NOTES:
if outputxpcfile is omitted or "-", it will be written to stdout


xpcdel
------

PURPOSE:
Removes a block o patches (given the description) of a XPC file.

SYNTAX:
xpcdel -desc[ription] "Patch description" [xpcfile]

NOTES:
if xpcfile is omitted or "-", it will be read from stdin and written to stdout


xpcdump
-------

PURPOSE:
Copy a single block of patches (given its description) from a XPC file to
another.

SYNTAX:
xpcdump -desc[ription] "Patch description" [inputxpcfile] [outputxpcfile]

NOTES:
if inputxpcfile is omitted or "-", it will be read from stdin
if outputxpcfile is omitted or "-", it will be written to stdout
outputxpcfile is overwritten if already exists


xpcgen
------

PURPOSE:
Creates a XPC file from a text file in the same format of the xpcview output.

SYNTAX:
usage: xpcgen [inputfile] [outputxpcfile]

NOTES:
if inputfile is omitted or "-", it will be read from stdin
if outputxpcfile is omitted or "-", it will be written to stdout
inputfile must be in same format as xpcview output


xpcmake
-------

PURPOSE:
Creates a XPC file containing a single block, from the difference of two ROM
files.

SYNTAX:
xpcmake -desc[ription] "Patch description" -type {ask|noask} [-o xpcfile] originalrom modifiedrom

NOTES:
if xpcfile is omitted or "-", it will be written to stdout


xpcmodify
---------

PURPOSE:
Modifies the description of a block of patches.

SYNTAX:
usage: xpcmodify -desc[ription] "Patch description" [-newdesc[cription] "New patch description"] [-type {ask|noask}] [patchfile]

NOTES:
if xpcfile is omitted or "-", it will be read from stdin and written to stdout


xpcview
-------

PURPOSE:
Displays the content of a XPC file in a human readable format.

SYNTAX:
usage: xpcview [xpcfile]

NOTES:
if xpcfile is omitted or "-", it will be read from stdin
