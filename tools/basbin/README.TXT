BAS-BIN.COM is a file converter, it converts BASIC (loadable) files
into BIN (bloadable) files.
This program belongs to a Brazilian utility package called Nemesis Tools.
The files converted by this utility hang my SVI738, this fact made me to
disassembly, bug-fix and slightly enhance the program.
